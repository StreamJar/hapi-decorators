# Hapi Decorators
Typescript decorators for interacting with hapi.

This project is heavily influenced by [hapior-decorators](https://github.com/Boulangerie/hapiour-decorators). We used this in production at StreamJar for ~ 2 years. When upgrading to hapi 17+ we opted to rewrite to fit our use case better.
